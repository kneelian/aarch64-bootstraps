/*
	Here we have the start of a parser
	for a programming/scripting language
	for the kernel. Think of this as a
	proof of concept program rather than
	anything production-ready (for various
	definitions of production you can
	subject a toy bootloader and kernel to)

	Fairly simple operation scheme. The 
	kernel jumps into this and relinquishes
	control. For all intents and purposes
	the interpreter IS the system
	software in a way reminiscent of old
	BASIC or FORTH systems providing a
	simple software stack and the toold
	to build software upon that system.

	The general idea is to build the 
	language to be as simple as possible
	to parse and evaluate, while still
	being useful enough to work in.
	Laziness necessitated some really
	really strange design choices, so
	let's first get those out of the
	way here:

		- the source code is UCS-2-encoded
		stream of CJK characters from the
		BMP
		- each instruction, keyword or
		command must fit inside two 
		bytes AKA one character each
		- variable names must also fit 
		inside exactly two bytes AKA
		one character each again
		- when it comes to integer
		constants, i really don't know
		what to do other than put
		yijing hexagrams as a 
		sort of base 64 encoding
		scheme (but this makes it
		variable width). i don't want
		to do things like use hangul
		or other hanzi for encoding
		numerals more compactly mostly
		because that'd make the source
		completely illegible and opaque

	The interpreter is really just
	a fancy trawler of bytecode: it
	consumes about one character at
	a time (two bytes), and interprets
	it: there is no tokenisation step,
	input is immediately decoded as
	soon as it's consumed and the decoder
	controls whether the consumer will
	get another character or carry on.

	There is no structural whitespace
	and all whitespace tokens are skipped
	when encountered, as are all unknowns.
	Error checking is obviously done
	only at runtimeas the code is not 
	trawled through beforehand.

	I'll have to design the input system
	pretty carefully, since I want not
	only for the code to be configurable
	before runtime, but also for the user
	to be able to *input* code into the
	interpreter, store and run it.
	Basically I wanna set up a primitive
	REPL loop which'll allow the user
	to input CJK into the thing and then
	get it running interactively.

	This sounds like a lot of goals so
	best get started huh.
